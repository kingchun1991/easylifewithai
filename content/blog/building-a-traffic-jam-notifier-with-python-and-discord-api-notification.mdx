<CustomAlert type="info">

Jasper AI, ChatGPT was instrumental in creating this article.

</CustomAlert>

On Some day of work, I was in a traffic jam on my way work. I left the bus and walk 10min to the MTR station where I can catch a train. After reaching work, I started thinking how to build something that can notify me in similar situations.

Since Python is my preferred language and I wanted to try out the Discord API, I decided to use both these technologies together and write a simple program which will let me know when there is traffic congestion on roads.

First, I used the Discord API to create an alert bot that will check for traffic jam updates from Open API from government. Open API provides real-time traffic updates which are used to fetch the live data. I wrote code in Python language that will help me access this API and alert me in case of traffic jam using Discord notification.

To make it more useful, I added an AI component for count the numbers of vehicle on the road. With this, I can now get real-time traffic updates as well as estimated vehicle count on that particular area. This helps me to make decisions quickly and plan my daily commute efficiently.

### The python code provided by chatGPT is not perfect as it's counting inaccurately:

```python
import cv2
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Load image
image = cv2.imread('/content/BC101F.JPG')

# Load Haar cascades
car_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('/content/cars.xml')

# Convert image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Detect cars using Haar cascades
cars = car_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.1, 1)

# Count cars
vehicle_count = len(cars)

# Draw bounding boxes around cars
for (x, y, w, h) in cars:
    cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

# Display vehicle count
cv2.putText(image, "Vehicle count: " + str(vehicle_count), (50, 50),
            cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 255, 0), 2)

# Display image
# Display image using Matplotlib
plt.imshow(image)
plt.show()
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### I finally found a better Python library that allows me to output better result

```python
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cvlib as cv
from cvlib.object_detection import draw_bbox

im = cv2.imread('/content/BC101F.JPG')
bbox, label, conf = cv.detect_common_objects(im)
output_image = draw_bbox(im, bbox, label, conf)
plt.imshow(output_image)
plt.show()
print('Number of cars in the image is '+ str(label.count('car')))
print('Number of cars in the image is '+ str(label.count('truck')))
```

### Discord Python API from ChatGPT

> Could you help me to write a python program using discord API to send a photo attachment with caption

```python
import discord

client = discord.Client()

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print('Logged in as {0.user}'.format(client))

@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    if message.author == client.user:
        return

    if message.content.startswith('!sendphoto'):
        # Get the photo file path and caption from the message content
        content = message.content.split(' ')
        photo_path = content[1]
        caption = ' '.join(content[2:])

        # Open the photo file and create a discord.File object
        with open(photo_path, 'rb') as f:
            file = discord.File(f)

        # Send the photo with the caption as a message
        await message.channel.send(content=caption, file=file)

# Replace 'your_token_here' with your bot token
client.run('your_token_here')
```

### Combining two source code

Now that I have code for both traffic jam notification and vehicle count estimation, I can combine them to get the best of both worlds. With this program, I can now be notified in real-time about the traffic jam as well as estimated number of vehicles on a particular stretch of road. This helps me to plan my commutes more efficiently.
